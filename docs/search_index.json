It is the technology that was used to obtain the first human genome sequence. Second generation sequencing is also called next generation sequencing (NGS) and is the start of high throughput sequencing. It is what scientists use most often nowadays, and Illumina is the market leader. Most of the rest of this course will cover data analysis using second generation sequencing. Third generation sequencing is single-molecule sequencing. There are many new technologies still under active development, although none has reached market penetration. 3.2 FASTQ and FASTQC NGS generates FASTQ files. FASTQC is an computational approach to evaluate the quality of your NGS data. 3.3 Early sequence alignment (1 with 1) In the early days (1970s), scientists were not worried about having to align too many sequences. They wanted to find the best alignment between two sequences. Many bioinformatics courses start with learning these, although it is not the main focus of our course. We included two videos in case you are interested. The Needlemen-Wunsch algorithm is the earliest algorithm to find the alignment between two sequences and score their similarity. When two sequences are long, and only a portion of them can align well with each other, the Smith-Waterman algorithm can find the best local sequence alignment. It is still considered the best alignment approach, although it is slow. 3.4 Sequence search algorihtms (1 with many) With more and more sequences available in the public in the 1980s, scientists were interested in finding whether their newly sequenced string has been sequenced before in the public database. Therefore, the fast search algorithm BLAST was developed, using one sequence as the query to find similar sequences from a database. 3.5 Borrow-Wheeler Aligner (many with many) With NGS, scientists need much faster search (aka mapping) algorithms in order to align the millions of sequences to the reference genome. The current best algorithm is called Borrow-Wheeler Aligner or BWA. In order to understand BWA, we first need to introduce Borrows-Wheeler transformation and LF mapping The basic idea of Borrows-Wheeler alignment 3.6 Alignment output NGS raw data is in FASTQ. Alignment gives you SAM (alignment) or BAM (binary version of SAM) files which contain the sequence information in FASTQ and the mapping locations. BED file is the simpliest, although there is information loss.

Dimension reduction techniques aim to reduce the dimension of representing each sample with tens of thousands of genes to much fewer demensions, e.g. 2 to 100. 7.1 Principal Component Analysis: idea behind PCA. PCA / SVD automatically outputs PC1, PC2, PC3, etc, with earlier PCs capturing the highest level of variability in the original data. Each PC is a linear combination of raw gene expression, and is orthogonal to all other PCs. 7.2 Principal Component Analysis: PCA applications. PCA is a widely used method to project samples with high dimensions (e.g. with gene expression data) onto two dimensions for better visualization. It is an intuitive way to identify sample clusters, and identify batch effect. 7.3 Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) MDS can use differential ways to calculate pair-wise distance, then use lower dimensions to satisfy the pair-wise distance. PCA is a special case of MDS. 7.4 Linear discriminant Analysis (LDA) LDA is not only a dimension reduction method, but also a supervised machine learning method.

Given a new sample of RNA-seq from the lung with unknown diagnosis, will you be able to predict based on the existing labeled samples and the expression data whether the new sample is normal or tumor? This is a sample classification problem, and it could be solved using unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. Unsupervised learning is basically clustering or dimension reduction. You can use hierarchical clustering, MDS, or PCA. After clustering and projection the data to lower dimensions, you examine the labels of the known samples (hopefully they cluster into separate groups by the label). Then you can assign label to the unknown sample based on its distance to the known samples. Supervised learning considers the labels with known samples and tries to identify features that can separate the samples by the label. Cross validation is conducted to evaluate the performance of different approaches and avoid over fitting. StatQuest has done an amazing job with machine learning with a full playlist of well organized videos. While the full playlist is worth a full course, for the purpose of the course, we will just highlight a number of widely used approaches. They include logistic regression (this is considered statistical machine learning), K nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine (these are considered computer science machine learning). 8.2 Supervised learning 8.3 Cross validation 8.4 Regression 8.5 Regularization 8.5.1 Ridge regression 8.5.2 LASSO regression 8.5.2.1 LASSO tutorial in R 8.6 KNN 8.7 Decision trees 8.8
